# github-webhook

Configurable GitHub WebHook deployable on CloudFoundry

# Inspiration
This Webhook was built in April 2017 to work around an issue we were experiencing with a high volume of clones
to Github Enterprise. This happened because [Concourse](https://concourse-ci.org/)'s [git-resource](https://github.com/concourse/git-resource) cloned the repository periodically based on the value of [check_every](https://concourse-ci.org/resources.html#resource-check-every) to determine if a change had occurred to the resource. Since then
Concourse now supports having a [webhook](https://concourse-ci.org/resources.html#resource-webhook-token) trigger a check of the resource which dramatically reduced the load on our Github Enterprise installation of which our Admins greatly appreciated. :) See [Pull Request #331](https://github.com/concourse/concourse/issues/331) for details on how it was done.



![github-webhook](docs/github-webhook.png "github-webhook")
```yaml
triggers:
  - name: master_webhook
    event: push
    rules:
      - ref: refs/heads/master
        pusher.name: username
        commits.modified: README.md
    run:
      path: script/trigger
      args:
        - "master"
```

The webhook matches by looking at the event (`push` or `pull_request`) and the rules that have been defined.

The Github [Push](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#webhook-payload-example-13) and
[Pull](https://developer.github.com/v3/activity/events/types/#pullrequestevent) events are flattened, so that we can
find a matching rule key and value.

For example, given `Push` event:

```json
{
  "ref": "refs/heads/master",
  "commits": [{
  "distinct": true,
  "message": "Update README.md",
  "author": {
    "name": "Mendez, Marcos",
    "email": "spam@somewhere.com",
    "username": "aaabbbccc"
  },
  "modified": ["README.md"]
  }], ...
}
```

We'll be able to create rules such as:

* ref: refs/heads/master
* distinct: true
* commits.author.username: username
* message: Update README.md
* commits.modified: README.md

# Getting Started

While this webhook is not directly coupled with Concourse, I've built it to provide functionality currently missing.
In order to minimize the polling to Github Enterprise.

*The better and long-term solution is to add this functionality into Concourse CI itself.*

## Pre-requisites

* Install `VirtualBox` or `VMWare` software hypervisor of choice
* Install [vagrant](https://vagrantup.com)
* Install & [configure](https://help.github.com/categories/setup/) git

  ```shell
  git config --global core.autocrlf input
  git config --global push.default simple
  git config --global user.name "My Name"
  git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
  ```

### Windows Users

    The deployment scripts require Windows x64 and CPU Virtualization
    Ensure that git is available from your command-line (Git Bash recommended)

## Concourse CI

If you haven't already done so, setup a CI server following Chris Gruel's instructional video on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WdSUxEIdO50).

### Build

* Make sure you've read and followed the *pre-requisites*
* Clone this repo
* Run `./vssh`. This will ssh into the disposable vm
* Run `script/cibuild` to run the build
```shell
git config --global core.autocrlf input
git clone <this repo>
cd github-webhook

./vssh

./script/cibuild
```
### Deploy

* Run `./vssh`. This will ssh into the disposable vm
* Setup Concourse CI URL
* Setup Concourse CI Target
* Setup User credentials in order to automatically retrieve a bearer token:
* Login to Concourse CI
* Run `script/concourse` to setup `github-webhook` and push [pipeline.yml](pipeline.yml)
* Login to NP CloudFoundry
* Setup GitHub Web Hook Secret
* Set CloudFoundry app name; `github-webhook` is already the default :)
* Run `script/deploy`
```shell
./vssh

export CONCOURSE_URL="http://<my-concourse-ci>.somewhere.com"
export CONCOURSE_TARGET=main
export GITHUB_LDAP_USERNAME=<ldap-user-name>
export GITHUB_LDAP_PASSWORD=<ldap-password>
export GITHUB_SECRET=<my-github-secret>
export CF_APP_NAME=<my-cloudfoundry-webhook-app-name>

echo "remember to use the same ldap credentials to login to test getting a bearer token"
fly -t $CONCOURSE_TARGET login -c $CONCOURSE_URL

script/concourse

cf login -a api.run.somewhere.com

./script/deploy
```

Note that `script/deploy` does not bind any routes to the deployed `github-webhook` app. After deployment,
it's necessary to bind the desired route to the app via `cf map-route` such that the app is available to GitHub over HTTP.

### GitHub

You can use an existing project for this, or create a new one if you're not too sure yet.

* Follow the [instructions](https://developer.github.com/webhooks/creating/) on adding a webhook using the PCF app webhook (e.g. `https://<my-webhoook-app>.apps.somewhere.com/postreceive`)
* Make sure you use the same secret defined in `GITHUB_SECRET`

![github-add-webhook](docs/github-add-webhook.png "github-add-webhook")

* You can enable `Push` and `Pull request` event types

![github-add-events](docs/github-add-events.png "github-add-events")

### Test It

* Make a change and commit it or create a pull request, or re-deliver an existing delivery
* Run `cf logs <my-webhook-app>`
```shell
$ cf logs github-webhook
Connected, tailing logs for app github-webhook in ...

OUT 2016/10/03 09:53:14 Executing github_push
OUT 2016/10/03 09:53:14 Redirecting stdout/stderr for github_push
OUT triggered by push
OUT logging into http://XXXX.somewhere.com/main
OUT target saved

OUT triggering job github-webhook/github-webhook
OUT started github-webhook/github-webhook #1
OUT 2016/10/03 09:53:14 github_push was successful!
```

### Make It Your Own

* Fork this project for your team (e.g. clone it, rename it, tweak it)
* Look at the following configuration files [config.simple.yml](config.simple.yml) [config.concourse.yml](config.concourse.yml) [config.concourse.rules.yml](config.concourse.rules.yml)
* Look at the following scripts: [script/concourse](script/concourse) [script/settings](script/settings) [script/trigger](script/trigger) [script/trigger-check](script/trigger-check)
* Change CONFIG_YML on [script/settings](script/settings) to deploy different configurations
* Turn on [autoscaling](http://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/1-8/appsman-services/autoscaler/autoscale-configuration.html) for your webhook
* Contribute to the project
